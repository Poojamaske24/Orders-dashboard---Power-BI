- Line charts for trend analysis of sales and profit over time.
- Tables and matrices for displaying detailed data such as customer order details.
- Slicers for interactive filtering of data by different dimensions.

**6. Insights from the Charts as well as Dashboards:**
Insights derived from the charts and dashboards include:
- Identification of top-performing regions, categories, and products.
